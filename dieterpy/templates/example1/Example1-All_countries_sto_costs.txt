In this example, we would like to see the optimal investments for each country when we reduce the overnight storage cost for the two components 'energy' and 'power' for Li-Ion. 
We have to edit two files: iteration_main_file.csv in the folder 'iterationfiles' and features_node_selection.csv.

The main iteration file modifies variables and constraints in the DIETER model.gms and also some default parameters that are included in excel files contained in the 'basicmodeldata' folder. All the remaining parameters, not included in the iteration remain intact as obtained from the excel files.

- We do not include as column the term 'country_set', by doing this, it means that we will consider all the countries as included in the excel file.
- We assume then that the set 'n' contains all the countries.

In the features_node_selection.csv we have to deactivate all the activated features by replacing 1 to 0.

Finally read/edit the project_variables.csv
