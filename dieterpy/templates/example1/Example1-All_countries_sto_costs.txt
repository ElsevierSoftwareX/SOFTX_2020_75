In this example, we would like to see the optimal investments for each country when we reduce the annualized investment costs for the two components 'energy' and 'power' for Li-Ion battery. 
We have to edit two files: iteration_table.csv in the folder 'iterationfiles' and features_node_selection.csv.

The main iteration file modifies variables and constraints in the DIETER model.gms and also some default parameters that are included in excel files contained in the 'data_input' folder. All the remaining parameters, not included in the iteration remain intact as obtained from the excel files.

- We do not include a column heading 'country_set', by doing this, it means that we will consider all the countries as included in the excel file.
- We assume then that the set 'n' contains all the countries.

In the features_node_selection.csv we have to deactivate all the activated features by replacing 1 to 0.

Finally read/edit the project_variables.csv
