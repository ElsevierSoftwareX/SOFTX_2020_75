In this example, we want to understand the effect of electric vehicles with a charging/discharging dispatch for optimized power system. 
We have to edit two files: iteration_main_file.csv in the folder 'iterationfiles and features_node_selection.csv.

The main iteration file modifies variables and constraints in the DIETER model.gms and also some default parameters that are included in excel files contained in the 'basicmodeldata' folder. All the remaining parameters, not included in the iteration remain intact as obtained in excel files.

- The only country considered is Germany as the column country_set contain DE only.
- We assume then that the set 'n' only contains DE.
- We vary the minimum renewables generation share for Germany by including the column phi_min_res_exog(n). Note: If we consider more than one country we may specify the share for each country by replacing the 'n' for 'DE' for example, and so for the other countries.
- We define the number of electric vehicles we want to assess. We add a column ev_quant(n).
- We also vary if we include vehicles-to-grid (V2G) or not. We add a column with EV_DISCHARGE.fx(n,ev,h), when we set it to zero this feature is deactivated. If we leave it empty, then we keep this variable activated with means we are including in our analysis the V2G feature.

In the model.gms (DIETER), we have two constraints with different equations. One of those equations has to be selected for each constraint. The constraints are constraint_minRES and constraint_carbon. If we do not include the constraint names as columns in the iteration file, then the model chooses the default option for each of them, which is the first one in the list. The table is located in constraints_list.csv in the 'settings' folder.

In the features_node_selection.csv we have to activate the ev_endogenous option by replacing 0 to 1.

Finally read/edit the project_variables.csv
