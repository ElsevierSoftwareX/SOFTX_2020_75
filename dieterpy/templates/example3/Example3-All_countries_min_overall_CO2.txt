In this example, we want would like to see the optimal investments for each country when we remove minimum renewable share constraint and we establish a maximum overall carbon emission. 
We have to edit two files: iteration_main_file.csv in the folder 'iterationfiles and features_node_selection.csv.

The main iteration file modifies variables and constraints in the DIETER model.gms and also some default parameters that are included in excel files contained in the 'basicmodeldata' folder. All the remaining parameters, not included in the iteration remain intact as obtained in excel files.

- We do not include as column the term 'country_set', by doing this, it means that we will consider all the countries included in the excel file.
- We assume then that the set 'n' contains all the countries.
- We remove the minimum renewables generation share constraint for all countries by including the column phi_min_res_exog(n) and set it to zero.
- We define set the second equation of the constraint 'constraint_carbon' which is called 'max_overall_CO2'. You can verify alternative equations for each constraint by checking the file constraints_list.csv in the 'settings' folder. You can also see its implementation in model.gms in the 'model' folder.
- As we want to vary the maximum overal carbon emissions for all countries we include a column 'co2_cap' which represnts the maximum allowed of total carbon emission in millon tonnes of CO2.

In the model.gms (DIETER), we have two constraints with different equations. One of those equations has to be selected for each constraint. The constraints are constraint_minRES and constraint_carbon. If we do not include the constraint names as columns in the iteration file, then the model chooses the default option for each of them, which is the first one in the list. The table is located in constraints_list.csv in the 'settings' folder. 

In the features_node_selection.csv we have to deactivate all the activated features by replacing 1 to 0.

Finally read/edit the project_variables.csv
