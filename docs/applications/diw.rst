Model applications by DIW Berlin researchers
=========================

Applications of the DIETER model have been published in a growing number of peer-reviewed articles. Many of these applications were co-authored by DIW Berlin researchers, as the model was initially developed at DIW.

Two companion articles introduce the basic model version and investigate optimal electrical storage capacity in long-run scenarios with very high shares of renewable energy sources:

* Zerrahn & Schill (2017): Long-run power storage requirements for high shares of renewables: review and a new model, *Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews*, 79, 1518-1534. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2016.11.098
* Schill & Zerrahn (2018): Long-run power storage requirements for high shares of renewables: Results and sensitivities, *Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews*, 83, 156-171. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2017.05.205

Reduced model versions have been used for more general reflections on the economics of electrical storage and its changing role in settings with increasing renewable penetration:
* Zerrahn, Schill, & Kemfert (2018): On the economics of electrical storage for variable renewable energy sources. *European Economic Review* 108, 259-279. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euroecorev.2018.07.004
* Schill (2020): Electricity storage and the renewable energy transition. *Joule* 4, 1-6. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2020.07.022
* L처pez Prol & Schill (2021): The Economics of Variable Renewables and Electricity Storage. *Annual Review of Resource Economics*, accepted for publication, https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15371

Other model applications have explored power sector effects of solar prosumage in Germany and Wester Australia:
* Schill, Zerrahn & Kunz (2017): Prosumage of solar electricity: pros, cons, and the system perspective. *Economics of Energy and Environmental Policy* 6(1), 7-31. https://doi.org//10.5547/2160-5890.6.1.wsch
* Say, Schill & John (2020): Degrees of displacement: The impact of household PV battery prosumage on utility generation and storage. *Applied Energy* 276, 115466. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.115466
* G체nther, Schill, & Zerrahn (2021): Prosumage of solar electricity: tariff design, capacity investments, and power sector effects. *Energy Policy* 152, 112168. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2021.112168

Another model application explored the power sector impacts of electric vehicles in Germany, focussing on reserve provision and vehicle-to-grid:
* Schill, Niemeyer, Zerrahn & Diekmann (2016): Bereitstellung von Regelleistung durch Elektrofahrzeuge: Modellrechnungen f체r Deutschland im Jahr 2035. *Zeitschrift f체r Energiewirtschaft* 40 (2), 73-87. http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12398-016-0174-7

Another paper introduced a module with residential power-to-heat options and an application focussing on the flexibilization of legacy night-time storage heaters:
* Schill & Zerrahn (2020): Flexible electricity use for heating in markets with renewable energy. *Applied Energy* 266, 114571. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.114571

A hydrogen module was introduced and applied to explore the trade-off between energy efficiency and temporal flexibility of various green hydrogen supply chains:
* Stoeckl, Schill & Zerrahn (2020): Green hydrogen: optimal supply chains and
power sector benets. *arXiv preprint* https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03464
