Applications of the DIETER model have been published in a growing number of peer-reviewed articles. Many of these applications were co-authored by DIW Berlin researchers, as the model was initially developed at DIW.

Two companion articles introduce the basic model version, which we now refer to as `DIETERgms 1.0.2 <https://gitlab.com/diw-evu/dieter_public/dietergms/-/tree/1.0.2>`_, and investigate optimal electrical storage capacity in long-run scenarios with very high shares of renewable energy sources:

* Zerrahn & Schill (2017): Long-run power storage requirements for high shares of renewables: review and a new model, *Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews*, 79, 1518-1534. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2016.11.098
* Schill & Zerrahn (2018): Long-run power storage requirements for high shares of renewables: Results and sensitivities, *Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews*, 83, 156-171. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2017.05.205

Reduced model versions have been used for more general reflections on the economics of electrical storage and its changing role in settings with increasing renewable penetration:

* Zerrahn, Schill, & Kemfert (2018): On the economics of electrical storage for variable renewable energy sources. *European Economic Review* 108, 259-279. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euroecorev.2018.07.004; model code available on `Zenodo <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1170554>`_.
* Schill (2020): Electricity storage and the renewable energy transition. *Joule* 4, 1-6. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2020.07.022; model code available on `Zenodo <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3935702>`_.

Other model applications have explored power sector effects of solar prosumage in Germany and Western Australia:

* Schill, Zerrahn & Kunz (2017): Prosumage of solar electricity: pros, cons, and the system perspective. *Economics of Energy and Environmental Policy* 6(1), 7-31. https://doi.org//10.5547/2160-5890.6.1.wsch; model version `DIETERgms 1.2.0 <https://gitlab.com/diw-evu/dieter_public/dietergms/-/tree/1.2.0>`_
* Say, Schill & John (2020): Degrees of displacement: The impact of household PV battery prosumage on utility generation and storage. *Applied Energy* 276, 115466. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.115466; model code available on `Zenodo <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3693286>`_.

To analyze the effects of tariff design on prosumage decisions, a model version with a mixed complementarity problem (MCP) instead of a linear optimization problem was developed and applied to Germany:

* Günther, Schill, & Zerrahn (2021): Prosumage of solar electricity: tariff design, capacity investments, and power sector effects. *Energy Policy* 152, 112168. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2021.112168; model code available on `Zenodo <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3345783>`_.

Another model application, using a version now referred to as `DIETERgms 1.1.0 <https://gitlab.com/diw-evu/dieter_public/dietergms/-/tree/1.1.0>`_, explored the power sector impacts of electric vehicles in Germany, focussing on reserve provision and vehicle-to-grid:

* Schill, Niemeyer, Zerrahn & Diekmann (2016): Bereitstellung von Regelleistung durch Elektrofahrzeuge: Modellrechnungen für Deutschland im Jahr 2035. *Zeitschrift für Energiewirtschaft* 40 (2), 73-87. http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12398-016-0174-7

Another paper introduced a module for residential power-to-heat options and an application focussing on the flexibilization of legacy night-time storage heaters, using model version `DIETERgms 1.3.0 <https://gitlab.com/diw-evu/dieter_public/dietergms/-/tree/1.3.0>`_:

A hydrogen module was introduced and applied to explore the trade-off between energy efficiency and temporal flexibility of various green hydrogen supply chains:

* Stöckl, Schill & Zerrahn (2020): Green hydrogen: optimal supply chains and power sector benefits. *arXiv preprint* https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03464; model code available on `Zenodo <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3693305>`_.
