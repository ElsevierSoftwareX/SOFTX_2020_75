Recently, spin-off versions and applications of the DIETER model have been developed without involvement of the initial DIETER team. We expect that our recent DIETERpy improvements will spur more of such activities. We do not systematically track external DIETER-based articles, but are happy to mention these here whenever we get noticed by respective authors.

In a report for the Australian Energy Market Operator, CSIRO used a DIETER version to derive cost projections for various generation technologies:

A DIETER-based analysis of power sector effects of demand-side management in India was developed by PIK researchers:

* Ershad, Pietzcker, Ueckerdt & Luderer (2020): Managing power demand from air conditioning benefits solar PV in India scenarios for 2040, *Energies* 13 (9), 2223. https://doi.org/10.3390/en13092223

Methodological aspects of modeling long-term storage have been explored by CIRED researchers:

* de Guibert, Shirizadeh & Quirion (2020): Variable time-step: A method for improving computational tractability for energy system models with long-term storage, *Energy* 213, 119024. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2020.119024

Together with PIK colleagues, we are further working on coupling a stylized DIETER version with PIK's REMIND model.
