Features in nodes
------------------

``features_node_selection.csv``: In this file, you can switch on and off different modules for specific nodes (i.e., countries).

The file looks as folls (the comment column is not shown).

If a ``0`` is set in the respective cell, that particular module is not activated in that country. In contrast, a value ``1`` will activate the module in the respective country.

We briefly describe the modules below. Note that several modules have so far only been parameterized with input data for Germany, and not necessarily for other countries.

dsm: Demand-side management
    This module contains two types of demand-side management (DSM): load curtailment and load shifting. Load curtailment means that demand can be reduced at some point in time without a repsective demand increase at a later point in time. A recovery period and a maximum curtailment duration are implemented with respective constraints. Load shifting, in contrast, means that DSM units which are shifted up in a given hour must be shifted down again in surrounding hours, which is again enforced by respective contraints. We provide input data for different types of both load shifting and load curtailment options, which differ in terms of investment and variable costs as well as duration times. An in-depth description of DIETER's DSM formulation is provided in Zerrahn & Schill (2015): On the representation of demand-side management in power system models. Energy 84, 840-845. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2015.03.037. DSM, in particular load shifting, implies a substantial amount of intertemporal restrictions in the model, which may heavily increase computation times. We thus provide the option to simply switch on and off this module.

ev_endogenous: Endogenous electric vehicles
    Further explanations will be added soon, as whis module is work in progress. The electric vehicle feature has been first used in Schill et al. (2016): Bereitstellung von Regelleistung durch Elektrofahrzeuge: Modellrechnungen für Deutschland im Jahr 2035. Zeitschrift für Energiewirtschaft 40 (2), 73-87. http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12398-016-0174-7

ev_exogenous: Exogenous electric vehicles
    Here we also include electric vehicles, but do not allow for endogenous charging and discharging decisions; instead, we use exogenous time series for vehicle charging and neglect the option of vehicle-to-grid energy flows.

reserves: Reserves
    This module contains a reserve model, which introduces an exogenous demand as well as an endogenous supply of different qualities of reserves. We differentiate primary, secondary and minute reserves. Mimicing the German market setting, primary reserves are assumed to be provided in a symmetric way (no differentiation between positive and negative reserves); in contrast, the demand and supply of secondary and minute reserves are differentiated between respective positive and negative segments. Various generation, storage, and DSM technologies are assumed to be able to contribute to reserve provision; for some sector coupling technologies, modeling their contribution to reserve provision is still work in progress. Importantly, reserve capacities do not only have to be provided, but all reserves are also (partially) activated, using historic German activation time series. This prevents the model from selecting only technologies with very low provision costs, but high reserve activation costs. Switching on the reserve module may substantially increase the computation time.

prosumage: Prosumage
    This module allows taking into account the effects of decentral PV self-generation facilitated by distributed batteries. Specified shares of the overall solar PV capacity and electric load can be attributed to a prosumage segment. In each hour, energy generated by prosumage PV may be either consumed directly, sent to the market, curtailed, or enters the prosumager battery. An hourly prosumage energy balance ensures that prosumager demand is satisfied, by direct self-consumption, consumption of energy from the market or discharging from prosumager storage. Energy flows between the battery and the grid may be separately enabled or disabled. The prosumage module is described in more detail and was applied in Schill et al. (2017): Prosumage of solar electricity: pros, cons, and the system perspective. Economics of Energy and Environmental Policy 6(1), 7-31. https://doi.org//10.5547/2160-5890.6.1.wsch

heat: Heat provision
    This module introduces various power-to-heat options for the residential heating sector. This includes direct resistive heaters, electric storage heaters, and water-based heating systems, which serve both space heating needs and domestic hot water demand. Water-based heating includes both ground-sourced and air-sourced heat pumps as well as fossil-fueled boilers with an auxiliary electric heating rod, which all supply heat to a buffer storage. Exogenous time series of heating energy demand are differentiated for twelve German building archetypes and a synthetic weather year. Model equations and additional assumptions used in the residential heat module are described in more detail in Schill & Zerrahn (2020): Flexible electricity use for heating in markets with renewable energy.
