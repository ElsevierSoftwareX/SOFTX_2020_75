Wolf is Deputy Head of the Department Energy, Transportation, Environment at DIW Berlin and leads the group Transformation of the Energy Economy. He is interested in various aspects of the renewable energy transformation. Together with Alexander Zerrahn, he is one of the fathers of the DIETER model. He made substantial contributions to the initial model development, different types of model extensions, and various applications.

Carlos is a research associate at DIW Berlin, holds a PhD from The University of Manchester and an Industrial Engineering degree. His research focuses on the sustainability assessment of energy systems and finding sustainable pathways for future energy economy by implementing optimization models, life cycle assessment (LCA), and machine learning techniques. He is interested in outreach his work by developing open-source tools using Python and is the father of the Python wrapper for DIETER, that is DIETERpy.

*Claudia Günther*
""""""""""""""""""

As a working student and for her master thesis, Claudia developed a model version in a mixed complementarity problem (MCP) format. She used this MCP-version of DIETER to explore the effects of tariff design on prosumage decisions. For this work, which also led to a peer-reviewed article in `Energy Policy <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2021.112168>`_, Claudia received the GEE price for the best master thesis in 2019.
