A GAMS-Python framework for DIETER
==================================

DIETER is an open-source power sector model. It has been developed to investigate the role of electricity storage and sector coupling options in future scenarios with high shares of renewable energy sources. The model determines optimal investment and dispatch decisions for generation, flexibility, and sector coupling technologies for all consecutive hours of a year.
DIETER is fully implemented in the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS), we present here the novel feature of Python-based data pre- and post-processing, scenario analysis, and visualization.
